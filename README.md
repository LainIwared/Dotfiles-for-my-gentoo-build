this repo includes all my handydandy useful configs and apps i use, i would like to add that the taskbar transparancy is a kde applet called panel transparancy toggle this is what allowed me to have the transparant look. 
I would also like to add that in most DEs' if you right click on the application launcher you can then add your own image to be displayed.
